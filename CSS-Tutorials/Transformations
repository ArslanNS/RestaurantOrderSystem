#Transformation allows you to change images and shapes in different ways.

transform: rotate(-10deg);

#Rotate allows you to roate the block a certain amount of degrees

transform: skew(20deg,10deg);

#Skew allows you to change the angles of the x and y axis(Make it more like a parallelogram)

transform: scale(2);

#Scale allows you to enlarge or shrink an image
#If you wanted to do x and y axis seperatly you would put in to parameters and they would effect the corresponding axis.

transform: translate(100px,200px);

#Translate allows you to mive the box around both vertically and horizontally

#NOTE: You can combine different transforms by simply putting them after each other

transform-origin: 0 0;

#Origin is used to choose the center of the transforms, so you can control where the rotations or and other transform work around
